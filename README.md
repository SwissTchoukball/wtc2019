# WTC 2019 microsite

This is the microsite that was set up for the participation of the Swiss teams to the World Tchoukball Championships 2019.

It used to be on https://wtc2019.tchoukball.ch, but was decommissioned. The content was moved to the new website of Swiss Tchoukball on http://tchoukball.ch/equipes-nationales/competitions/wtc2019 and http://tchoukball.ch/equipes-nationales/competitions/wytc2019.

## Requirements

This microsite uses [Pico](http://picocms.org/) as CMS, “_a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS_”.

It is PHP-based. Therefore it is required to have PHP installed, as well a [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```
php composer.phar install
```
